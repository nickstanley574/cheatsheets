<h2 id="hacking-exposed-7-network-security-secrets--solutions">Hacking Exposed 7: Network Security Secrets &amp; Solutions</h2>
<h3 id="chapter-1-footprinting">CHAPTER 1 FOOTPRINTING</h3>
<p>The systematic and methodical footprinting of an organization enables attackers to create a near complete profile of an organization’s security posture. Using a combination of tools and techniques, coupled with a healthy dose of patience and mind-melding, attackers can take an unknown entity and reduce it to a specific range of domain names, network blocks, subnets, routers, and individual IP addresses of systems directly connected to the Internet, as well as many other details pertaining to its security posture.</p>
<p>Footprinting is necessary for one basic reason: it gives you a picture of what the hacker sees. And if you know what the hacker sees, you know what potential security exposures you have in your environment.</p>
<p>Archived Information - Be aware that there are sites on the Internet where you can retrieve archived copies of information that may no longer be available from the original source. These archives could allow an attacker to gain access to information that has been deliberately removed for security reasons.</p>
<p>One of the most serious misconfigurations a system administrator can make is allowing untrusted Internet users to perform a DNS zone transfer. A zone transfer allows a secondary master server to update its zone database from the primary master. This provides for redundancy when running DNS, should the primary name server become unavailable. Generally, a DNS zone transfer needs to be performed only by secondary master DNS servers. Many DNS servers, however, are misconfigured and provide a copy of the zone to anyone who asks. This isn’t necessarily bad if the only information provided is related to systems that are connected to the Internet and have valid hostnames, although it makes it that much easier for attackers to find potential targets. The real problem occurs when an organization does not use a public/private DNS mechanism to segregate its external DNS information (which is public) from its internal, private DNS information. In this case, internal hostnames and IP addresses are disclosed to the attacker. Providing internal IP address information to an untrusted user over the Internet is akin to providing a complete blueprint, or roadmap, of an organization’s internal network.</p>
<p><strong>Traceroute</strong> is a diagnostic tool originally written by Van Jacobson that lets you view the route that an IP packet follows from one host to the next. Traceroute uses the time-to-live (TTL) field in the IP packet to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED message from each router. Each router that handles the packet is required to decrement the TTL field. Thus, the TTL field effectively becomes a hop counter. We can use the functionality of traceroute to determine the exact path that our packets are taking. As mentioned previously, traceroute may allow you to discover the network topology employed by the target network, in addition to identifying access control devices (such as an application-based firewall or packet-filtering routers) that may be filtering our traffic.</p>

<h4 id="types-of-information-security-testing">types of information security testing:</h4>
<p>Vulnerability scan—This scan examines the security of individual computers, network devices or applications for known vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are identified by running a scanner, sniffers, reviewing configurations, etc.</p>
<p>Security assessment—This builds upon thevulnerability assessment by adding manual verification of controls to confirm exposure by reviewing settings, policies and procedures</p>
<p>Penetration test—This happens one step ahead of a vulnerability assessment. It takes advantage of the known and unknown (e.g., zero-day attacks) vulnerabilities. It also makes use of social engineering techniques to exploit the human component of cybersecurity.</p>
<h4 id="strategy-internal-vs-external">Strategy: Internal vs. External</h4>
<p>External—This is, perhaps, the most widely-used form of pen-testing. It addresses the ability of a remote attacker to get to the internal network.</p>
<p>Internal—Contrary to what management usually thinks this is, it is not a strategy applicable to vulnerability assessment work only. Pen-tests can be run internally when the goal is to simulate what would happen if a company’s own employeeattempted to carry out an attack from within or if an attacker managed to gain access to a network.</p>

<h4 id="types-of-password-attacks">Types of password attacks:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rainbow Tables: High-storage, Low Processing Time, Offline Only</li>
<li>Brute Foice : Low -storage, high processing time, on or offline</li>
<li>Dictonary: High storage, medium processing time, on or offile</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Desktop Services (RDS) - By default the server listens on TCP/3389 (can be changed)</p>
<h3 id="acounts">Acounts:</h3>
<pre><code>- User - person
  - Local and Domain Accounts
  - Domain accounts are held on the domain controllers and replicated throughout the domain and can be used for authentication against the domain or other systems and applications using AD authentication
- built-in - system defined at install 
- service ccount - used to start service but not linked to a person 
  - Powerful accounts used to start/stop services or interact with other systems

<h3 id="security-identifier-format">Security Identifier Format</h3>
<ul>
<li>SID – Security Identifier</li>
<li>An example: S-1-5-21-1454471165-1336601894-839522115-500
<ul>
<li>1 is the revision of the SID</li>
<li>5 is authority value</li>
<li>21 and threee sets of values are called sub authority values</li>
<li>500 is called the RID</li>
<li>RID 0 Relative Identifer
<ul>
<li>Builtin: Guest=501 Administrator=500</li>
<li>Users start at 1001 and increment</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="groups">Groups</h3>
<ul>
<li>Groups allow you to add multiple user accounts to a container to apply, or restrict, permissions that the user has on the system or in the domain</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="windows-authorization">Windows Authorization</h3>
<ul>
<li>The “list” is known as a DACL – Discretionary Access Control List</li>
<li>SAM
<ul>
<li>The SAM in AD is very similar to that of a local system</li>
<li>The AD SAM holds all AD account information including users, The AD SAM holds all AD account information including users,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hash-types">Hash Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>LanMan (LM) hash – older format used for backwards compatibility with legacy systems. Upper case 2 7 char hashes.</li>
<li>NTLM – newer format which doesn’t have the flaw that LM has</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="salt">Salt</h3>
<ul>
<li>An unsalted hash is one that simply uses the same key (or the same static value) on every system)</li>
<li>For example, if we both run Windows XP/7 systems, and both of our passwords are “apple” then the password hash on both systems would be the sam</li>
<li>A salted password hash is one that uses some other value, in addition to the static value, as a modifier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cached-passwords">Cached Passwords</h3>
<p>If you’re system is a member system of a Microsoft Active Directory domain (drop down in the login) what happens if you’re not connected to the network.</p>
<p>Yes, we can get them, and since they are salted, no, we cannot just crack them as we would a SAM file password ha</p>
<h3 id="network-authentication">Network Authentication</h3>
<p>MS uses LM, Net-NTLMv1, Net-NTLMv2, and Kerberos for network authentication,</p>
<h3 id="windows-hash-format">Windows Hash Format</h3>
<p>Account_name:RID:LM_Hash:NTLM_Hash:::</p>
<h3 id="password-cracking-tools">Password Cracking Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cain  – Windows, easy to use GUI, has dictionary/brute-force/hybrid attacks, many algorithms supported.</li>
<li>John the Ripper -  Windows/*nix, command-line, very fast, good options for word mangling and brute-force, can be patched to support additional algorithms.</li>
<li>Rainbow Tables/Ophcrack -  time-memory trade off allows pre-computaion of hashes, 99%+ success rate</li>
<li>hashcat/multiforcer -Windows/*nix, utilizes the GPU in place of the CPU for faster brute-forcing and rainbow table crackin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-1">Other</h3>
<p>Rainbow tables generate hashes of all plaintext inputs, you store all these hashes in a table, and when you crack you are simply performing a match for the correct hash</p>
