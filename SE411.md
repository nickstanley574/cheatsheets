# SE411 Notes

## Introduction

A IDC Analyst showed that on average **80%** of system outages are caused by operator or application errors. Everything else days empathizes speed: agile development, business agility etc. Speed might be a goal but it's an outcome! You don't get fast by just going fast. Greyhournd know how to run but it takes training to get them to RUN month and month of ward works. 

### The Myth of Technical Excellence
The Myth of Technical Excellence - whenever we have really hard problems to solve we tend to look for tech-based solutions. THIS IS VERY WRONG! Good Tech is necessary but not sufficient, Software is a **human endeavor** and its useless if there aren't good process to support them, which means CD is about Tech and PEOPLE. We don't solve tech problems we solve people problems. 

Constant incremental improvements typically lead to greater gains than leader, periodic leaps. We are looking at evolving our processes, practices, and people rather than revolutionizing them. 

Software development is essentially a series of experiments. What we delivery (VALUE) and how we deliver it (PROCESS). 

New Technology and tools DO NOT fix a culture, person, or process problem. Comparatively speaking, computers are easy, people are harder. The human factors trumps everything, without voluntary adoption, people find ways to subvert tech. In fairness, there are a lot of problems that can be solved with good tech tooling, but the adoption of too many techs can lead to integration and process problems. 

If CD is the goal we need to emphasizes: 
1. Building Quality in. (We can't compromise quality for speed)
2. Working in small batches
3. Let the computer do the repetitive work and let people solve problems. (Thats more fun anyway)
4. Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement. 
5. Everyone is responsible. 

In time of you focus on these 5 items you will BECOME fast. 

Too often the content of software is thought to be code, the content is business value code is just the mean of delivering that value. Reliably identification and prioritization of values is CRITICAL **(IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS YOU WILL FAIL)**. If you're building the wrong things, fast deploys only ensure that you ship the wrong things faster. (Not a great ROI story) 

Big bangs changes can cause distractions. 
1. Development or testing churn. 
2. Downtime (planned or unplanned) 
3. Let the computer do the repetitive work and let people SOLVE PROBLEMS 
4. Relentlessly purse continuous improvement 
5. Everyone is responsible 

Small batches allowed delivering constant flow of business value.

Doing CD require organizational change! 

Need to balance tech with people; neither one alone guarantee success. 

### Software Economics

All for-profit businesses have the same basic goal – to make money. 

Simple ways to measure ROI:
- Saving by reducing the amount  of unplanned work 
- Saving by reducing outages from bad releases
- Values of activities enabled by the first two options. 

```
cost_of_excess_rework = tech_staff_size * 
                        average_salary * 
                        benefits_multiplier *
                        percent_of_time_on_rework

cost_of_downtime      = deploy_frequency *
                        change_failure_rate (%) *
                        mean_time_to_recover *
                        hourly_outage_cost
```

### Continuous Delivery and DevOps 

Development is also the “experts” when it comes to how its application functions and what it requires to operate successfully. Operations is responsible for the runtime operation and environments of the delivered software.

DevOps promotes a set of processes and methods for thinking about communication and collaboration between development, QA, and IT operations.

According to Martin Fowler, you're doing CD when: 
1. Software is deployable at any time 
2. Deployability is more important than new features 
3. Fast, automated feedback on the prod readiness of all system on any change.
4. On-demand push-button deployments, any version, and environment. 

The Goal is to have low cycle-time (plan -> code -> build -> test -> release -> deploy -> operate -> monitor -> repeat), and high quality releases. 

DevOps Principles: 
1. Every Change leads to a potential release. 
2. Must have repeatable, reliable process for software releases.
3. Automate almost everything. 
4. Keep everything in version control.
5. If it hurts, do it often and bring the pain forward. 
6. Build quality in. 
7. Done means released.
8. Everyone is responsible for the delivery process. 
9. Continues improvement 

### Risks and Rewards 

Release should be Repeatable, Reliable, and Predictable. 

No developing in prod-like environments can lead to: (1) Inconsistencies in hardware configs (2)  Inconsistent behavior between lower, test envois and higher, prod envs. (3)  An inability to test hardware and software configs before they are introduced into higher-envs.   

**No one cares if it works on your machine.** Higher environments may be the first time the operations team has
seen the release. All installers, assemblies, configurations, etc. have only been tested in environments that are nothing like production. Different cluster members have different versions of OS, patches, middleware, libraries, etc. **We need to treat configuration like code.**

**One technique: frequent releases!**
- Rewards: 
    - The more frequent the release, the less change is needed.
    - Rollbacks are less risky.	
    - Feedback is faster.
    - Value is realized more quickly.
- Risk: Cost of bugs getting into production.
    - Assumptions: 
        - We know what our customers want. 
        - Bugs are expensive.
        - Testing takes a long time. 
        - All bugs can be found in test.
- Risk: New releases will annoy users.
    - Assumptions: 
        - Releases incur downtime.
	    - Users will notice changes.
	    - Changes are visible to all users.
- Risk: Cost of release is greater than its value.
    - Assumptions: 
        - High coordination overhead. 
        - Releases are risky.
        - Deployment is time consuming.

**Contrary to conventional wisdom, we need to embrace failure – it’s not only always an option, it’s inevitable. WE need to Learn how to fail better! Use cheaper, less reliable hardware. If processes are risky, do them often. Don’t punish people for outages.**

## Theory of Constraints and Value Steam

### Value Stream Mapping 

**Value-stream mapping** is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer with reduced lean wastes as compared to current map.

Value Stream Mapping offers:
- Offers a holistic view of how work moves through a system.
- Maps of material and information flows across the organization.
- Captures value-added work from non-value-added work.

Useful Metrics: 
- **Total lead time (TLT)** - The time needed to complete a process from the time work is ready until that work is complete. 
- **Total Process time (TPT)** - The total time required to actually complete a process. This is typically much less than the TLT. 
- **Process cycle efficiency (PCE)** - `Total process time / total lead time`. The Percentage of the TLT that involves actual work. 
- **Percent complete and accurate (%C&A)** - The percentage of work that each of a processes' downstream consumers considers ready. Anything less Then 100% represents waste.  
- **Rolled  %C&A** -  The overall %C&A for the entire value stream. This is just the %C&A of each process in the value stream multiplied together. 
- **Takt Time** - It's the cycle time ended to keep up with customer demand. Takt time = `available production time per-day / Demand per day`. (IF the Toal lead time is greater then take time the org will not keep up with demand.)

### The Theory of Constraints

**The theory of constraints (TOC)** is a management paradigm that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. There is always at least one constraint, and TOC uses a focusing process to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it. TOC adopts the common idiom "a chain is no stronger than its weakest link". This means that processes, organizations, etc., are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely affect the outcome.

Simple/basic premises: 
1. Every system is constrained in some way
2. Any changes to the system that do not improve throughput at the constraint cannot improve the throughput of the overall system.

## The Three Ways

### 1. The Principles of FLOW: 

- Make work visible
    - Use visual management.    
    - Avoid trigger work from emails and chats - all work should flow through the same process of prioritization.
    - Make sure that each work center has its own queue of work.
    - Use these work boards to capture important metrics
- Limit Work in Process (WIP)
    - People are horrible and multitasking (THIS IS FACT) 
    - Limit the number of concurrent tasks
    - Wait times need to be managed. `wait_time = % Resource is Busy / % Resource is idle`
- Reduce batch sizes
    - We want to deliver value as rapidly as possible.
- Reduce the number of handoffs
    - Information is always lost during handoffs.
    - Handoffs require time and effort to setup and coordinate.
- Continually identify and elevate constraints
    - To optimize:
        1. Identify the limiting constraint(s) in the stream.
        2. Exploit the constraint. If the constraint is idle, that value is lost forever.
        3. Subordinate everything to the constraint. This means other resources may be underutilized.
        4. Delays upstream don’t usually average out farther downstream other than by accident.
        5. Elevate the constraint. If cycle time is too long, there is more work to do.
        6. Find the next constraint and repeat the process.
    - Eliminate hardship and waste in the value stream
	    - Extra processes that add no value to the customer.
	    - Extra features that don’t meet either business or customer needs.
	    - Task switching.
	    - Heroics (DON'T BE A HERO YOU ARE NOT SUPERMAN YOU WILL HATE YOU LIFE) 

### 2. The Principles of FEEDBACK

Problems need to be visible. Feedback and feed forward loops can help address this. 

Prevents problems from moving downstream – easier and cheaper to fix them close to the point of origination.

Adding more steps to a process often makes that process even less reliable because it can lead to significant deviations between who should do a certain task who actually does that task. (Example Most documentation.) 

Common organizational cultures:
- **Pathological** - Large amounts of fear and threat. Information is hoarded or used for political gain. Failure is hidden. (RUN AWAY) 
- **Bureaucratic** - Governed by rules and processes. Teams defend their own area of responsibility. Failure works through some form of judgement. (Depends on the business demands can be good often is not needed) 
- **Generative** - Actively seeks and shares information. Responsibilities are shared across the value stream. Failure is reflected and improved upon. (This is the goal) 

If processes are not actively improved, they’ll degrade over time. 

Do not shy away from disruptions or failure. Become resilient by learning how to react too and recover from inevitable problems. Make opportunities to experiment and try new things so that you know where the failure points are in your organization and systems and how to deal with them.

Leaders encourage their people to embrace learning. Encourage employee experimentation by asking questions.

### 3. The Principles of CONTINUAL LEARNING AND EXPERIMENTATION.
