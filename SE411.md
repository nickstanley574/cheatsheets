# SE411 Notes

## Introduction

A IDC Analyst showed that on average **80%** of system outages are caused by operator or application errors. Everything else days empathizes speed: agile development, business agility etc. Speed might be a goal but it's an outcome! You don't get fast by just going fast. Greyhournd know how to run but it takes training to get them to RUN month and month of ward works. 

### The Myth of Technical Excellence
The Myth of Technical Excellence - whenever we have really hard problems to solve we tend to look for tech-based solutions. THIS IS VERY WRONG! Good Tech is necessary but not sufficient, Software is a **human endeavor** and its useless if there aren't good process to support them, which means CD is about Tech and PEOPLE. We don't solve tech problems we solve people problems. 

Constant incremental improvements typically lead to greater gains than leader, periodic leaps. We are looking at evolving our processes, practices, and people rather than revolutionizing them. 

Software development is essentially a series of experiments. What we delivery (VALUE) and how we deliver it (PROCESS). 

New Technology and tools DO NOT fix a culture, person, or process problem. Comparatively speaking, computers are easy, people are harder. The human factors trumps everything, without voluntary adoption, people find ways to subvert tech. In fairness, there are a lot of problems that can be solved with good tech tooling, but the adoption of too many techs can lead to integration and process problems. 

If CD is the goal we need to emphasizes: 
1. Building Quality in. (We can't compromise quality for speed)
2. Working in small batches
3. Let the computer do the repetitive work and let people solve problems. (Thats more fun anyway)
4. Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement. 
5. Everyone is responsible. 

In time of you focus on these 5 items you will BECOME fast. 

Too often the content of software is thought to be code, the content is business value code is just the mean of delivering that value. Reliably identification and prioritization of values is CRITICAL **(IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS YOU WILL FAIL)**. If you're building the wrong things, fast deploys only ensure that you ship the wrong things faster. (Not a great ROI story) 

Big bangs changes can cause distractions. 
1. Development or testing churn. 
2. Downtime (planned or unplanned) 
3. Let the computer do the repetitive work and let people SOLVE PROBLEMS 
4. Relentlessly purse continuous improvement 
5. Everyone is responsible 

Small batches allowed delivering constant flow of business value.

Doing CD require organizational change! 

Need to balance tech with people; neither one alone guarantee success. 

### Software Economics

All for-profit businesses have the same basic goal – to make money. 

Simple ways to measure ROI:
- Saving by reducing the amount  of unplanned work 
- Saving by reducing outages from bad releases
- Values of activities enabled by the first two options. 

```
cost_of_excess_rework = tech_staff_size * 
                        average_salary * 
                        benefits_multiplier *
                        percent_of_time_on_rework

cost_of_downtime      = deploy_frequency *
                        change_failure_rate (%) *
                        mean_time_to_recover *
                        hourly_outage_cost
```

### Continuous Delivery and DevOps 

Development is also the “experts” when it comes to how its application functions and what it requires to operate successfully. Operations is responsible for the runtime operation and environments of the delivered software.

DevOps promotes a set of processes and methods for thinking about communication and collaboration between development, QA, and IT operations.

According to Martin Fowler, you're doing CD when: 
1. Software is deployable at any time 
2. Deployability is more important than new features 
3. Fast, automated feedback on the prod readiness of all system on any change.
4. On-demand push-button deployments, any version, and environment. 

The Goal is to have low cycle-time (plan -> code -> build -> test -> release -> deploy -> operate -> monitor -> repeat), and high quality releases. 

DevOps Principles: 
1. Every Change leads to a potential release. 
2. Must have repeatable, reliable process for software releases.
3. Automate almost everything. 
4. Keep everything in version control.
5. If it hurts, do it often and bring the pain forward. 
6. Build quality in. 
7. Done means released.
8. Everyone is responsible for the delivery process. 
9. Continues improvement 

### Risks and Rewards 

Release should be Repeatable, Reliable, and Predictable. 

No developing in prod-like environments can lead to: (1) Inconsistencies in hardware configs (2)  Inconsistent behavior between lower, test envois and higher, prod envs. (3)  An inability to test hardware and software configs before they are introduced into higher-envs.   

**No one cares if it works on your machine.** Higher environments may be the first time the operations team has
seen the release. All installers, assemblies, configurations, etc. have only been tested in environments that are nothing like production. Different cluster members have different versions of OS, patches, middleware, libraries, etc. **We need to treat configuration like code.**

**One technique: frequent releases!**
- Rewards: 
    - The more frequent the release, the less change is needed.
    - Rollbacks are less risky.	
    - Feedback is faster.
    - Value is realized more quickly.
- Risk: Cost of bugs getting into production.
    - Assumptions: 
        - We know what our customers want. 
        - Bugs are expensive.
        - Testing takes a long time. 
        - All bugs can be found in test.
- Risk: New releases will annoy users.
    - Assumptions: 
        - Releases incur downtime.
	    - Users will notice changes.
	    - Changes are visible to all users.
- Risk: Cost of release is greater than its value.
    - Assumptions: 
        - High coordination overhead. 
        - Releases are risky.
        - Deployment is time consuming.

**Contrary to conventional wisdom, we need to embrace failure – it’s not only always an option, it’s inevitable. WE need to Learn how to fail better! Use cheaper, less reliable hardware. If processes are risky, do them often. Don’t punish people for outages.**
